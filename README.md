# Word-Guess-Game
### This is a programming hangman game.
* It selects a word at random and shows you how many letters the word has.
* It is then your turn to guess letters to try and figure out the word.
* As you press keys on the keyboard it will either fill in every instance of the letter, if you guessed a letter correctly, or it will take away one of your allotted guesses and display the letter as guessed.
* Once either you guess the word correctly or run out of guesses the game will restart choosing a new word, keeping track of your wins.

This project is meant to demonstrate our ability to solve problems and write javascript to create a functioning game.

### Ben Houston designed and created this hangman game for his coding bootcamp.
